# Description of the dataset and the aim of the analysis

TODO change
In a recent study we have identified thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for different histone marks using individuals from the Yoruban (YRI) population [2]. In our case, histone (h)QTLs are SNPs for which the genotype correlate with the variation of histone H3K27ac signal within a H3K27ac peak. Here we will investigate how many of these previously identified hQTLs show allele-specific binding in individuals from a different population (CEU; European). 


The example dataset consists of the following files:

* 14,000 previously identified H3K27ac QTLs for individuals from the YRI population [1,2]
* H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data for two individuals (GM10847, GM12890) obtained from Kasowski et al [2] from the CEU population (two replicates each). The reads have previously been mapped to the personalized phased genomes of these individuals [2]	
* Corresponding genotypes for the SNPs were obtained from the *1000 Genomes Project* [3]
